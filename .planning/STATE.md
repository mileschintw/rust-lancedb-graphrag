# Project State

## Current Status

- Phase 1 completed successfully.
- Phase 2's initial six-plan implementation and gap-closure plans 02-07 through 02-10 completed, but verification found additional reliability, evidence-gate, inspector, and privacy-enforcement gaps.
- Verified gap-closure plans 02-11 through 02-16 are ready to execute.

## Active Phase

- **Phase:** 2
- **Status:** Ready to execute
- **Current Plan:** 11
- **Phase Progress:** 10 of 16 plans complete (62.5%)
- **Current Focus:** Execute Phase 02 gap-closure plans 02-11 through 02-16

## Completed Phases

- **Phase 1: Basic Gateway & Rust Engine Ping** (Completed: 2026-07-13)

## Known Issues & Debt

- Phase 02 verification found seven open truths covering ambiguous admission, eventual compensation, challenge freshness, caller-owned input safety, explicit-path inspection, corrupt embedding rejection, and privacy enforcement.
- Plans 02-11 through 02-16 cover those truths plus review warnings WR-01 through WR-04.
- Pre-existing RAG and graph query stubs remain recorded in the phase deferred-items ledger for their owning phases.

## Deployment & Environments

- Local PostgreSQL connectivity and Atlas schema application verified for plan 02-01.

## Decisions

- [Phase 02-01]: Reserve bounded Tokio queue capacity before LanceDB persistence so rejected uploads cannot create orphaned raw documents. — Queue exhaustion must reject before consuming durable local storage.
- [Phase 02-01]: Use a shared base TOML plus LANCET_ENV overlays in both runtimes. — Go and Rust need one environment-selection contract.
- [Phase 02-01]: Keep live ingestion state in Arc DashMap while PostgreSQL remains the gateway metadata source. — This is the thinnest viable scaffold for polling before later persistence work.
- [Phase 02-02]: Force JSON uploads through fixed-size chunking. — JSON strings may contain Markdown-like tokens but must remain raw text.
- [Phase 02-02]: Cache o200k_base in OnceLock and estimate tokens before persistence. — Downstream embedding and vector-storage work receives stable per-chunk token counts.
- [Phase 02-03]: Use ~major.minor Cargo requirements for two-component declarations with patch-only updates. — Matches the requested manifest format without permitting automatic minor-version drift.
- [Phase 02-03]: Keep direct Arrow crates on the 58.3 patch line. — LanceDB 0.31 exposes Arrow 58 types; Arrow 59 would create incompatible public types.
- [Phase 02-03]: Fail startup on any LanceDB schema field drift. — Indexing must not proceed against incompatible persisted storage.
- [Phase 02-04]: Keep durable raw-content staging after queue reservation, then let the single worker replace document graph rows. — Preserves queue rejection semantics while making re-ingestion repairable.
- [Phase 02-04]: Persist only completed or failed engine states in PostgreSQL. — Queued and processing remain live engine states until terminal reconciliation.
- [Phase 02-04]: Generate and validate RFC 4122 UUIDv4 document IDs at both runtime boundaries. — Prevents predicate/path injection and keeps gateway/engine IDs compatible.
- [Phase 02-05]: Keep raw admission data in staged_documents until a complete canonical replacement succeeds.
- [Phase 02-05]: Recover a lost conditional terminal update only by re-reading and verifying the winner.
- [Phase 02-06]: Run the final live gate against a dedicated verification LanceDB store so pre-existing schema generations cannot influence acceptance.
- [Phase 02-06]: Preserve only the fresh validated run as canonical verification data and remove stale Phase 02 rows, stores, challenges, and evidence.
- [Phase 02-07]: Capture canonical LanceDB versions before mutation and route every post-snapshot error, including staging cleanup, through one rollback funnel.
- [Phase 02-07]: Use a five-second context.Background compensation timeout so request cancellation cannot strand failed-ingest metadata.
- [Phase 02-07]: Keep all Rust fault fixtures and integrity tests in engine/src/tests.rs, leaving production code with only the standard test-module declaration.
- [Phase 02-08]: Keep REQUEST_TIMEOUT as the single ten-second reqwest builder contract; the test seam may vary endpoint and retries but never the production timeout.
- [Phase 02-08]: Derive inspector identity and integrity verdicts only from filtered durable LanceDB rows, rejecting missing, mixed, duplicate, stale, or non-contiguous state before JSON output.
- [Phase 02-08]: Keep real LanceDB inspector fixtures outside engine/src/bin so Cargo does not discover test-only code as a production binary target.
- [Phase 02]: Run every challenge, evidence, freshness, privacy, and durable-store decision through explicit Python checks under isolated mode.
- [Phase 02]: Copy provider/model/generation/duplicate/stale/continuity facts directly from the Plan 02-08 inspector output; do not attest hardcoded verdicts.
- [Phase 02]: Keep challenge and evidence paths as exact ignored files and remove both only after final current-store reconciliation succeeds.
- [Phase 02]: Keep all fixtures and negative tests in scripts/test_phase02_live_evidence.py; production shell files contain no test-only harness.
- [Phase 02-10]: Final acceptance required the validator exit zero and direct current PostgreSQL/LanceDB comparison before cleanup.
- [Phase 02-10]: Git Bash was used for the unchanged validator because the WSL launcher had incompatible Cargo path semantics.
- [Phase 02-10]: Challenge and evidence artifacts remain exact-ignored and absent after success.
